      <h2>I don't know...</h2>

      <p>I don't even know bakit ko ginagawa toh, ano pang silbi ni toh? Para saan? Hindi ko naman responsibilidad gawin
        toh di'ba? Pero kasi, may part sa sarili ko na gustong malaman mo o gustong sabihin sayo kahit napaka walang
        kwenta siguro nito para sayo. Siguro may ibang part sa mga sasabihin ko na ilang beses kona sinabi sayo, pero
        kung masabi ko man yun at least alam mong hindi ako sinungaling di'ba?</p>

      <p>You know for a long time, i mean not exactly a "long" time since it was only since last s.y but i've always,
        always hated the part of you acting like you wanted me and then the next day you don't. As much as i hated it,
        iniintindi ko nalang talaga kasi alam ko kung ano mga pinagdaraanan mo kahit hindi kana magsalita saakin. I know
        rin naman na may kanya-kanya tayong buhay but hey? Sinong hindi malulungkot at maiinis kung ikaw ba naman i-leave
        sa seen or delivered everytime na nag c-chat ka, knowing that buong magdamag siyang naka-hawak sa phone niya
        bakit hindi niya magawa mag reply o kahit man lang mag react?</p>

      <p>I always felt irritated at myself everytime i reach out to you, always ending up like a damn fool who yearns for
        your attention. What am i? A dog? A child longing for their mother or what? To be honest, hindi ko gusto kung
        paano ako naapektuhan sayo, kung paano mo'ko naapektuhan, na kahit simpleng salita mo lang umaarte akong parang
        baliw na sumusunod sayo. I hated myself that even though i know your situation, i know you're busy over your
        studies, i can't help but wanted to be selfish. Like i wanted to be someone who you centers your attention to,
        hindi ba nakakainis yun? Kahit ako naiinis eh.</p>

      <p>Pero anong magagawa ko? Bakit, may tayo ba? May karapatan ba'ko mag salita? Sino ba'ko para sayo? Kung
        magkagusto ka man sa iba edi yun na yun, hindi din naman kita mapipigilan. Pero kung tatanungin mo'ko o kung si
        ash mag tanong saakin, ayoko ko, hindi naman sa pinipigilan kita magkagusto sa iba. Ayoko lang nakikita na bakit,
        bakit everytime na when it comes to others you always seems like you were genuine? Why was it that when it was
        with me before, i can't even understand you, hindi ko alam ano bang natakbo sa utak mo. Hindi ko masabi na
        kung yung mga sinasabi mo ba ay totoo o hindi eh, you always act indifferent that it messes my head up.</p>

      <p>Do you think ba masama na'kong tao? Napaka makasarili ko ba? Na lagi ko lang iniisip kung anong makakapagkabuti
        saakin? Pero paano ka di'ba? Paano nararamdaman mo kung ganito ako? If i were to continue being like this, to
        continue being like a damn possesive dog i'll just worsen everything, i'll just hurt the both of us more and
        more. That's why kahit ganito ako pinipigilan ko nalang sarili ko, ayaw kitang guluhin, ayokong ipahalata na
        desperado ako sa atensyon mo. Na everytime na may mag c-chat saakin laging napasok sa isip ko na baka ikaw yun.
        Ayoko bumalik sa dati na halos lumuhod na'ko sa harapan mo wag ka lang umalis. Natanong ko rin sa sarili ko bakit
        ko ba ginawa yun? Eh ni-hindi ka nga naging sakin, hindi naging tayo, pero bakit kung makaasta ako akala mo naging
        tayo? Akala mo may karapatan ako sayo noh?</p>

      <p>Hindi ko gusto na konting chat mo lang nakukuha mo agad ako, na everytime na kausap kita hinihiling ko nalang na
        wag matapos agad. Na kahit man naglalakad ako o may ginagawa o kahit pa nasa kalagitnaan ng laro nagagawa kong
        mag reply sayo, makausap ka lang kahit saglit. Kaso kasi eh, ako kasi lagi nagmumukhang kawawa sa dulo. Lilitaw
        tas bigla kang mawawala na parang bula, mag c-chat ako sayo iiwanan mo'kong naka delivered or s-seen mo lang
        ako. Hindi ko alam ano ba talagang problema, ako ba? Alam ko namang busy ka at some point but it wouldn't hurt
        to spare a little seconds to reply back right? It wouldn't even take a whole hour. I tend to get anxious and
        overthink over little things in which i don't know when did i develop these. Was it because of similar
        experiences over and over or just lack of assurance?</p>

      <p>I've never told anyone nor ashley, but i actually never moved on from you. I might say "naka move on na'ko dun"
        and then bunch of other baseless lies just so i can cover up what i truly felt. Even to the point of saying i
        liked someone else or hindi muna ngayon. In denial lang talaga siguro ako, ayokong mahulog ulit ng sobra tapos
        ending ganun nanaman. Eh tignan mo ngayon? Nagmumukha nanamang baliw sayo.</p>

      <p>Back in grade 10, everytime na hindi tayo nag-uusap gustong-gusto ko lumapit sayo hindi ko lang magawa. Kasi
        gusto kong respetuhin bounderies mo, kung gusto mo ng peace of mind at mapag-isa hinahayaan lang kita, yun ang
        gusto mo eh sinusunod lang kita. But i never missed to tell you that i'm always here when you needed someone
        right? I don't wanna admit but i still failed to see through you at some times because of my own pride and
        selfishness. I never really tried to acknowledge your feelings sometimes and let my frustration to take over
        me.</p>

      <p>But i really did try, because i wanted to understand you better, i wanted to be someone you can rely on but what
        can i do if you really refuse to let me in? You've always pushed me away and i always thought i might just
        not be enough that's why. I'm not the best when it comes to comforting someone but i can listen to you for as
        long as you wanted, i'm socially awkard and can't even start a conversation but i always tried to do my best
        when it comes to you. Because i wanted to be different when it comes to you, no matter how embarrassing a
        simple "Hi" to me, i'll always go out beyond of what i know of myself just to talk to you.</p>

      <p>Everytime we passed by each other before whether is it in the hallway or sa canteen, laging nabalik tingin ko
        sayo pag nakatalikod kana. Everytime na naglalakad ako or kami nila ashley, i secretly looked for you. Na kahit
        likod mo palang kilala kona, and kahit likod mo lang nakita ko okay nako basta nakita na kita. I always act blind
        kapag nakikita kitang may kasamang iba, hanggang tingin lang naman kasi talaga kaya ko hindi kagaya nila.</p>

      <p>You might not know or never really actually knew but i've always wanted to talk to you again, i wanted to be
        close with you like i was before. That's why when i found out it was you who sent those flower along with the
        small message i had a mixed feelings. I was mad, so mad that i even confronted ashley about it, i was mad
        because why now? Why suddenly come back, but then on the other hand i was kinda glad because you found your way
        to talk with me again.</p>

      <p>I'm saying all of this not because i wanted to make you feel bad for me or something, i just wanted to say what i
        wanted, i wanted to let you know how i really felt and what i was doing during the those times. I wanted to be
        honest with you, away from those lies i spouted before.</p>

      <p>Nakakahiya naman toh...Anyway, advance happy valentine's!</p>
