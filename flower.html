                <p class="lead">Remember to always take care of yourself. No matter how hard it can be always keep your head up and look forward, you can always rely on me, on us. You're not alone, you have many people who value you highly and cares about you very much. Don't be scared to speak about your own feelings and experiences, no one's gonna judge you, not me, not them, no one. There might be a time you think "oh i don't think i can do this anymore" but then you go and be yourself again shows how you don't actually wanna give up, it's not "pretending" to be fine it's you showing that despite everything that happened you can always go back and stand up on your own feets. There's still many oppurtunity in the future, do not just throw them away just because of a certain someone who can't see your importance.</p>

                <p class="lead">Even on the days when progress feels invisible, remember that rest is not failure and slowing down doesn’t mean you’re falling behind. No one is perfect, no one can do something perfectly continuously so even if you failed at something one time just consider it as your lesson, a motivation for yourself to improve and be better. Mistakes shouldn't be treated as a humiliation to one but rather a lesson, a lesson that can serve as your inspiration to correct those past mistakes. Life isn't a straight line, everything's messy...Such as healing and growth they're messy and cannot be achieved in a straight road, they're uneven but also deeply human. Just take things one step at a time, do not rush everything, remember to always enjoy yourself and not just focus on your surroundings. Choose yourself more than anything again and again. You deserve patience, kindness, and a future built on people and moments that see your worth clearly. Trust that the strength you’ve already shown will keep carrying you forward, even when you don’t realize it yet. </p>

                <p class="lead">When everything feels like they're falling apart, when your doubts creeps in quietly, try to remember how far you’ve come, how much problem you've already faced and overcome. You know you didn't make it this far out of spite, everytime when the path you take feels uncertain there's a version of you who survived the things you probably thought would break you. And that version will always be with you, let it be your anchor. Always take care of yourself, don't let yourself be pressured for some things that isn't worth to be pressured on, don't push yourself too hard and know your limits. Take care not only of your body but also your mental health, remember to always seek help when you know you can't bear it alone. You don't have to handle everything on your own, you have people you can rely on always keep that on your mind. You're loved by many more than you know. (┳◡┳)</p>
